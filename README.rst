roboco.py
=========

Provides a very basic GUI interface for the robocopy cmd tool.

This is my first crack at usinf Tkinter so hopefully it goes well.

Soothsmith: in addition to updating for Python 3, I added checkboxes to mirror and to save a log file. See notes in script for directory expectation for log file.
